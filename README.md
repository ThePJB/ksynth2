OK fixed the envelope, it now works

todo:
        * make it draw ADSR curve too please
    * GUI overhaul
        * cro for compression will be a game changer


as for hte time domain uh, cro wave syncing up would be ideal, idk how to do that
what if we just draw the ring buffer, probably be all over the place lol.

spectrogram wouldn't even be that hard

i think the compression may be one sided as well

yea maybe for the compressor just have some basic amplitude vs time thing like a VU meter
moving max basically and then you can draw the cutoffs
maybe instead of da way i do volumes we could also set where hard clipping occurs
atm its fucky

i think if i want global volume its got to be global volume

update while turn knobs would be good please
updatesd(id), yea i can do that boss

add rest of notes ay
