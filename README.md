OK fixed the envelope, it now works

todo:
    * improve timeline drawing: dont do stupid row thing and also draw the held keys
        * make it draw ADSR curve too please
    * GUI overhaul
        * knobs
        * spectrum
        * cro for compression will be a game changer


as for hte time domain uh, cro wave syncing up would be ideal, idk how to do that
what if we just draw the ring buffer, probably be all over the place lol.

spectrogram wouldn't even be that hard

i think the compression may be one sided as well
